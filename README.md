We will predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. We are given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. 
we have to use the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data. To pass the challenge, model.evaluate must return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. 
This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.
